            <p>Hello and welcome to 'About Me', here's a little bit of info on my journey to where I am now. <br> I started my working life in a sports centre teaching children's holiday activities, I had done various courses in college to help me teach and then progressed on to teaching Trampolining at the same centre. It wasn't long before I started using the gym on site and decided to take my instructor qualifications in fitness instruction, and that's where my main role began. <br>
              I worked as an instructor in the gym for around 7 years, for 5 years of this I was an Exercise on Referral Instructor. This was a scheme driven to encourage exercise be prescribed by medical professionals to thos eit could benefit; stroke patients, amputees, rehabilitation after injury and many more. I also helped to start similar programmes in other gyms around the area.<br>After my time in fitness I moved to the ambulance serice, to me it seemed a logical progression 
              given all the knowledge of the human body I had already learned, and I started in te4h non-emergency services side where I worked for 7 years, 5 or so were based on the road. I travelled far and wide around the UK, transporting patients to and from Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge. For the final year and a half I was promoted to manage the contract for Addenbrookes and spent most of my time office based with less patient contact but more work bringing about positive 
              change for the staff still at the wheel.<br>
            But i missed fitness, and soon found myself looking for something a little more in that area. This is whe I began working for Life Fitness in their service team as a Service Contacts Advisor. I worked with sites to ensure cover on their equipment and set up new contracts for new installs. I got the chance to learn more about the equipment, which I had been using in gyms for years, and had a few site visits as well. Around 4 years in an oppourtunity arose to work in the 
            UK marketing team, I wrote several blog posts in support of my application and was lucky enough to be given the role for digital within the team. I ran the social accounts, website and email for the UK up until lockdown hit. At this time I was moved to the SSC team where I began my role as web and email specialist. I have thoroughly enjoyed this time learning as much as I can about marketing and also taking a course in coding. <br> So, to present day, I have been doing This
          course for a year or so, I've covered html, CSS and JavaScript. I'm now combining all these into this project to demonstrate what I've learnt. Its maybe harder than I first thought but will stand me in good sted for the future.<br>
        Along the way I picked up some skills, check them out below! </p>
