# Portfolio Project Read Me
===========================

## Project Description 

This project is the first off platform project including HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the Codeacamey Front End Engineer course. It will be a site about myself and contain three pages in total, About Me, Contact and Useful Links. The purpose is to explain more about myself and my skills I've learnt so far.

I have created a wireframe for my project and completing the README is one of my first tasks, but it will be built on as the project progresses.

### Features
+ About Me - brief intro into me and what got me to this point, likes, dislikes, hobbies etc.
+ Work History - my career path so far.
+ Skills section - all the skills I have learnt so far, not just coding wise.
